This program requires the following Python packages:

1. `pygame`: This package is used for creating 2D games in Python. It provides the necessary functions for drawing shapes, handling user input, and controlling the game loop.

2. `random`: This is a built-in Python module used for generating random numbers.

3. `pymunk`: Pymunk is a wrapper around the Chipmunk physics library, and it provides physics simulation functionality.

To install the necessary packages, you can use pip, which is the Python package installer. You can install them using the following commands in your command line:

```bash
pip install pygame
pip install pymunk
```

If you're using a Jupyter notebook, you can run these commands in a cell by prefixing them with an exclamation mark:

```bash
!pip install pygame
!pip install pymunk
```

Make sure you have pip installed and your Python environment properly set up before running these commands.
